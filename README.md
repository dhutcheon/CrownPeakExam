# CrownPeak Code Exercise

This is a C# .NET console application that incorporates two of the CrownPeak Code exercises: 1) Numbers to Words and 2) Best Poker Hand. "Numbers to Words" enables the user to enter any random number and convert it to written word form (English). "Best Poker Hand" runs a program that randomly deals hands to a pre-determined (by user) amount of players, and determines which hand wins.
